## language barriers
[HealthServe NGO found that language barriers and lack of awareness about healthcare services among foreign workers in Singapore were significant challenges](https://healthserve.org.sg/story/an-outsiders-look-into-migrant-workers-in-singapore/#:~:text=The%20Singapore%20government%E2%80%99s,time%20to%20address.)

## dormitory conditions:
["Since the onset of this pandemic, migrant workers have accounted for almost 90% of the over 60,000 cases confirmed in Singapore. The first wave of cases in early 2020 caused the government to put all dormitories on “lockdown” – restricting the movement of nearly 300,000 workers. This eventually extended to the Circuit Breaker – a stay-at-home order and cordon sanitaire that lasted for nearly 2 months."](https://law.nus.edu.sg/impact/covid-19-shedding-light-on-the-plight-and-laws-regulating-migrant-worker-dormitories-in-singapore/#:~:text=Since%20the%20onset%20of%20this,movement%20of%20nearly%20300%2C000%20workers.)<br>
