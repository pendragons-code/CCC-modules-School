### Problem Statement Technical Details:
Foreign workers in Singapore face challenges related to:

1. **Fair Wages**: Many are underpaid or face delays in payment.
2. **Safe Working Conditions**: Incidents of unsafe working environments are reported.
3. **Access to Skills Development**: Limited opportunities for vocational training and career advancement.
4. **Legal Rights**: Understanding and accessing legal protections and services.

### Proposed Solution:

#### 1. **Comprehensive Application Platform**

Create a user-friendly mobile application that serves as a centralized hub for foreign workers to access various services and information:

- **Language Courses**: Offer language training to improve communication skills, which are essential for navigating daily life and understanding rights and responsibilities.
  
- **Vocational Training**: Provide courses and certifications in relevant skills (e.g., construction, hospitality) to enhance employability and career advancement opportunities.

- **Legal Counseling Services**: Offer guidance on labor rights, contract disputes, and legal recourse in case of exploitation or abuse.

- **Employer and Government Collaboration**: Partner with employers to ensure fair treatment and promote inclusive hiring practices. Engage government agencies to enforce labor regulations and monitor workplace conditions.

#### 2. **Key Features of the Application:**

- **Profile Management**: Allow workers to create profiles detailing their skills, experience, and legal status.

- **Course Catalog**: Provide a catalog of language and vocational courses available, including schedules, locations, and costs.

- **Legal Resources**: Access to legal information, rights documentation, and contacts for legal aid organizations.

- **Job Listings**: Partner with employers to post job openings with fair wages and safe working conditions.

- **Feedback Mechanism**: Enable workers to provide feedback on employers anonymously, ensuring transparency and accountability.

#### 3. **Implementation Strategy:**

- **Partnerships**: Collaborate with NGOs, educational institutions, and legal aid organizations to provide comprehensive support.

- **User Training**: Conduct workshops and training sessions to educate workers on how to use the application effectively.

- **Government Engagement**: Work closely with government bodies responsible for labor and immigration policies to ensure alignment with regulatory frameworks and support initiatives.

#### 4. **Monitoring and Evaluation:**

- **Data Analytics**: Utilize data collected through the application to monitor trends, assess impact, and improve services continuously.

- **Feedback Loops**: Regularly solicit feedback from users and stakeholders to identify areas for improvement and address emerging challenges.

### Alignment with UNSDGs:

- **SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth)**: Promoting sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all.
  
- **SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities)**: Ensuring that no one is left behind, particularly vulnerable populations such as migrant workers, by promoting social, economic, and political inclusion.

- **SDG 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions)**: Promoting peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, providing access to justice for all, and building effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels.

### Conclusion:

By developing this application, you address the multifaceted challenges faced by foreign workers in Singapore, promoting a more equitable and fair work environment. The focus on computational thinking ensures a systematic approach to problem-solving, leveraging technology to enhance accessibility, transparency, and accountability. This solution not only supports local needs but also contributes to broader global goals of sustainable development and social justice.
